"""
Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.
MirrorTree1            

Input:
First line of input contains the number of test cases T. For each test case, there will be only a single line of input which is a string representing the tree as described below: 

The values in the string are in the order of level order traversal of the tree where, numbers denotes node values, and a character “N” denotes NULL child.

For example:


For the above tree, the string will be: 1 2 3 N N 4 6 N 5 N N 7 N

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print inorder traversal of mirror tree.

Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Just complete the function mirror() that takes node as paramter. The printing is done by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Number of nodes <= 100
1 <= Data of a node <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
1 3 2
10 20 30 40 60
Output:
2 1 3
30 10 60 20 40

Explanation:
Testcase1: The tree is
        1         (mirror)     1
     /      \         =>        /     \
   3       2                  2         3
The inorder of mirror is 2 1 3
Testcase2: The tree is
                           10                                      10
                        /        \           (mirror)         /        \
                     20         30            =>        30        20
                  /       \                                              /    \
               40       60                                        60    40
The inroder traversal of mirror is 30 10 60 20 40.
